From my understanding, you can add any object with any image, as shown in the file upload when you edit the style of, for example, the North Arrow. I struggled to find the correct way to change the image preset of the North Arrow without also opening a can of worms with 1. other presets of icons for map addon objects, and 2. uploading my own icons. Fundamentally it's a design of convenience that compromises a bit with the ability to add your own objects to the layout, which isn't necessarily a difficult thing, just a bit clunky to feel your way around when you're new to the (quite extensive) GUI.\n",
